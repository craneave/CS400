This was the third and final project for our group. This project used the code from my Dijkstra Algorithm implementation to create a Google Maps-type project. We used data from large Wisconsin cities and then using this data, allowed the user to input different starting and ending locations to figure out what the fastest path to each city would be.
My role for this project was the Algorithm Engineer, again, using Dijkstras Algorithm to find the shortest path between the cities. There is a ton of documentation within the code that explains a lot of what is going on with the actual algorithm and its implementation within the project.
All vertices are stored within a hashtable using the data stored within the vertex as a key. I kept track of all discovered paths by creating a new path object for each. For the actual Dijkstra algorithm method, it takes in any start and an end vertex, and then from that, produces a path object that represents the shortest path.
My code was then easily used by other group members to find out the shortest path between any two vertices.
This project worked entirely perfectly at the end and was tested by multiple members, via individual code, but also the project as a whole was tested. This was the final project and was the only project that had no errors in the end and was entirely functional, so it was very nice to see the growth through the semester of our group to learn and put it all together for the final project.
