This project was a solo implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two separate nodes. 
All vertices are stored within a hashtable using the data stored within the vertex as a key. I kept track of all discovered paths by creating a new path object for each.
For the actual Dijkstra algorithm method, it takes in any start and an end vertex, and then from that, produces a path object that represents the shortest path.
The rules for the actual algorithm can be found online, as it is already a well-known algorithm.
