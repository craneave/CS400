This is the second project for our group. For this project, using an XML file, took in a set of data of books, and searched for the books, (very similar to project one), however this time we used a red-black tree to store our data.
My role for this project was the datawrangler, so my code consits of taking in the XML file of book data, and then extracting that data into book objects with title, genre, author, and height, and then add all of them into a list.
This project was much better than the first and was a working program with everyones code together. A great improvment from the first.
