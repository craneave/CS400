This is the second project for our group. For this project, using an XML file, took in a set of data of books, and searched for the books, (very similar to project one), however, this time we used a red-black tree to store our data.
My role for this project was the data wrangler, so my code consisted of taking in the XML file of book data and then extracting that data into book objects with title, genre, author, and height, and then adding all of them into a list.
This project was much better than the first and was a working program with everyone coding together. A great improvement from the first. My code includes DataWranglerTests, BookLoader, IBookLoader, IBook, and Book.
