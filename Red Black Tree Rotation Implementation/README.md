This project is the first part of the red-black tree project in the CS400 folder. In this project, I implemented the first building blocks of the insertion algorithm for the red-black tree.
Firstly this was done by creating a rotation algorithm.
A short algorithm, and at the bottom of the code are some short tests to ensure that the rotation works accordingly for all different types of scenarios.
