So this is the first project done together as a team. I do not have access to other team members code, only my own, and then all of the place holder classes that I had created in order to test my codes functionality.
For this project I was the frontend developer, so my role was to develop the frontend for our project, to ensure it has a clean look, and convays the information that the backend of the code is computing.
Our project was a show searcher application, which would use an CSV file of shows that the DataWrangler would extract the data from these shows from. Then the algorithm engineer would take this data and store it with a hashtable, so that it is easily accesible for the backend.
The backends job was to then design the code that would search for the shows depending on how the user wished to search, then lastly my job was to take all of this and put it into the frontend for the user to explore through their options, searching, and then displaying the shows from their search.
Along with this my job also included making sure the user could not search incorrectly.
This project was a bit chaotic at first, as it was our fist project together as a group, and we had some mebers missing due to class drops and whatnot. Overall though we were able to work together and get something nearly fully functional.
Again I do not have the code of the others, only my code and placeholders.
